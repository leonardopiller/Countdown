# Countdown
Vanilla JS program that performs time operations and displays the remaining time until a specific date.


## How does it work?
- This program utilizes various native JavaScript functions for time operations, such as : `getFullYear()`, `getHours()`, `getMinutes()`, `getMonth()`, `getDay()`, etc.

- By using the native constructor `new Date()`, you can select a specific date and time by passing the year, month, hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds.

- When the `getRemainingTime` function is called, the remaining time in milliseconds is calculated and converted into hours, minutes, and seconds.

- The `getRemainingTime` function is then called every  second (1000ms) to ensure that the countdown is always updated.

## Usage
This countdown can be readily used by simply modifying the parameters of the `Date()` constructor. In this example, Christmas Eve was chosen, but you can select any future date.
It can be applied in an e-commerce site to display the time remaining for a giveaway or any other time-sensitive event.
